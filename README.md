# RTL Design and synthesis of scan-testable 32-bit Registers (for the RISC-V processor) with VHDL

This repository only contains the src code files. Workspace of Xilinx Vivado 2023.2. A set of 32 Registers (32-bit wide) according to RISC-V architecture. This Register Set can be ScanTestable using a TAP controller.

Tool: Xilinx Vivado 2023.2 HDL: VHDL Simulation done. DRC check done. Synthesis done. Implementation done. Bit-stream not performed.
